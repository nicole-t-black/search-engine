# Search Engine

A C++ implementation of a basic search engine that parses local web pages and responds to user queries with relevant matches.

## Overview

This project provides the core functionality of a commandâ€‘line search engine, including:

- Parsing plain text and HTML-like content via custom parsers
- Building inverted indices using combiners and utility modules
- Handling interactive user queries through a shell interface
- Managing webpage structures and search logic via `searcheng`
- Comprehensive parsing and query processing logic

## Features

- Text and webpage parsing
- Inverted index generation for efficient searching
- Interactive shell for user queries
- Modular architecture for parser, combiner, and search functionality
- Unit tests for validating parser behavior (`mdparser-tests.cpp`)
